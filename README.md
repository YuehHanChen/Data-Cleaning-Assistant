The Data Cleaning Assistant is a web application that suggests data cleaning tasks for a given dataset. It uses OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model to generate a list of necessary data cleaning tasks before feeding the dataset to a machine learning model.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply enter your OpenAI API key and upload a CSV file containing the dataset. The application will then generate a list of data cleaning tasks, along with Python/pandas code for each task.

## Prerequisites
To run the application, you will need to have an OpenAI API key. You can get your API key by visiting the OpenAI website.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set your OpenAI API key by setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
4. Run the application by running python app.py and visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser

## Usage
1. Enter your OpenAI API key and upload a CSV file containing the dataset
2. The application will generate a list of data cleaning tasks, along with Python/pandas code for each task
3. Review the generated code and make any necessary adjustments

## Warning
Do not upload any sensitive or confidential data, as OpenAI might use it to train its model. The application will only randomly select 50 rows to assess the dataset, and the suggestion generated by OpenAI should only be taken as a starting point. You should still explore the data and make adjustments as needed.
